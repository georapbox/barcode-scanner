Refining the design:
Added the timer and countdown for the items
Made layout changes to the landing page
Call to API that resolves UPC to an ingredient
UPC Resolves to a name 

Implementation and testing so far:
Confirmed barcode scanner works with several barcodes
Timer for items degredation is currently functional and customizable 


Problems and roadblocks encountered and how they were addressed:
Barcode scanner does not work with every barcode - Will try to implement feature that allows to add barcode 
Barcode scanner API does not allow unlimited scans - Current amount of scans is adequate for testing purposes, paid version available for unlimited scans
