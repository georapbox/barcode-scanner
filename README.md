# Barcode/QR code Scanner

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) that scans barcodes of various formats, using the [Barcode Detection API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Barcode_Detection_API).

> [!NOTE]
> The Barcode Detection API is part of the [Fugu](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) project. Currently it is supported only on Chromium browsers in MacOS and Android. For non-supporting browsers, a [polyfill](https://github.com/Sec-ant/barcode-detector) is used.
